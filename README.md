Diabetes Patients Data Analysis Report using Power BI

I am Interested in Data Analytics field and Probability and Statistics and Maths concepts.
I have been done this project while i was doing Data Analytics Internship at MeriSKILL Company.

Project Title: Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indian Women
Tools Used: Power BI

Got an opportunity to dive deep into data analysis with one of the projects at @MeriSKILL, “Predicting Diabetes in Pima Indian Women”, which helped me explore my skills and further my learning. I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to have a meaningful impact.

Problem Statement:
The objective of this data analysis project was to diagnostically predict whether a female patient of at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The primary problem is binary classification, where we aim to determine if a patient has diabetes (Outcome = 1) or not (Outcome = 0) based on the provided medical predictor variables. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Key Project Objectives:
·      Explore and understand the dataset, its structure, and the distribution of variables.
·      Pre-process the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning.
·      Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
·      Create informative visualizations to aid in data understanding and visualization.
·      Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

Charts and Graphs requirement:
1.    Donut chart for distribution of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic patients w.r.t. to different variables.
2.    KPI card for depicting the current value and status of a metric against a defined target.
3.    Scatter Plot to show the relationship between Glucose Level and BMI.
4.    Line Chart to show the trend of number of patients with respect to age group.
  
Key Insights:
1.    Out of 768 female patients, 268 were found to be diabetic, indicating a prevalence of 34.9%.
2.    The 20-60 age group saw the highest concentration of diabetic patients, accounting for 97% of cases.
3.    Alarmingly, 219 diabetic patients were identified as obese with a prevalence of 81.72%, highlighting a significant health concern.
4.    66.42% Diabetic Patients had normal Blood Pressure, and 65.67% Diabetic Patients had normal Glucose Levels.
5.    In terms of Diabetes Pedigree Function 47 % Diabetic Patients had High Risk of Diabetes. Subsequently 43% Diabetic Patient had Medium Risk and 10% Diabetic 
      Patient had Low Risk.
6.    Among the Non-Diabetic Patients 253 patients were found to be obese, 121 were found to be showing Diabetic symptoms with respect of Glucose Level.
7.    On the other hand 385 Non-Diabetic patients almost 77% of total were found to have normal Blood Pressure, and 50% Non-Diabetic patients were at Medium Risk 
      as per the Diabetes Pedigree Function.
      This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also emphasized the pivotal role of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. I’m enthusiastic about 
      the potential of this tool to support the healthcare professionals in improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of Diabetes.
      I’m eagerly looking forward to continuing my journey of learning and growth in this dynamic field. If you have insights, advice, or simply want to connect, 
      please don’t hesitate to reach out.
 
      Thank you for being part of my professional network, and stay tuned for more thrilling updated in the future!
